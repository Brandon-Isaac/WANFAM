# Components Directory

This directory contains reusable React components that can be utilized throughout the application. 

## Guidelines for Structuring Components

1. **Component Naming**: Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `MyComponent.jsx`).
2. **File Structure**: Each component should have its own directory containing:
   - The component file (e.g., `MyComponent.jsx`)
   - A CSS file for styles (e.g., `MyComponent.css`)
   - A test file (e.g., `MyComponent.test.js`) if applicable.
3. **Exporting Components**: Always export components as default to simplify imports.

## Usage

To use a component in your application:
1. Import the component at the top of your file:
   ```javascript
   import MyComponent from '../components/MyComponent/MyComponent';
   ```
2. Include the component in your JSX:
   ```javascript
   <MyComponent />
   ```

## Best Practices

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- Use props to pass data and callbacks to child components.
- Maintain a consistent style and structure across all components for better maintainability.
