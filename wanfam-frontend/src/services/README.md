# Services Directory

The `services` directory is responsible for handling API calls and business logic for the application. It provides a centralized location for managing interactions with external services and data sources.

## Structure

- Each service file should correspond to a specific feature or resource in the application.
- Service files should export functions that encapsulate API calls and any related business logic.

## Usage

To use a service in your components or other parts of the application:

1. Import the service function:
   ```javascript
   import { fetchData } from '../services/myService';
   ```

2. Call the function as needed, typically within a React component or a custom hook:
   ```javascript
   useEffect(() => {
       const getData = async () => {
           const data = await fetchData();
           // Handle the data
       };
       getData();
   }, []);
   ```

## Best Practices

- Keep service functions focused on a single responsibility.
- Handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user.
- Consider using a library like Axios for making HTTP requests to simplify API interactions.
