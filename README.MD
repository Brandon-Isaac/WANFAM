## Project Details

**Title:** WANFAM - Comprehensive Livestock Care System (CLCS)  
**Category:** Web Application Development  

---

## Background & Rationale

Kenya's livestock sector is vital but faces challenges in record-keeping, health management, and productivity tracking, especially for small to medium-scale farmers. Existing digital solutions are often costly, complex, or lack offline and bilingual support.

**Key Problems:**
- Missed vaccinations/treatments
- Inefficient resource allocation
- Poor health outcomes
- Limited access to financial services

**Target Beneficiaries:**
- Small/medium-scale farmers (5-50 animals)
- Rural communities
- Veterinary providers, extension officers, financial/insurance institutions

---

## Objectives

**Main Objective:**  
Develop an affordable, user-friendly web-based livestock management system with integrated health tracking, feeding management, and productivity analysis for Kenyan farmers.

**Specific Objectives:**
1. Integrated health management (tracking, reminders, history)
2. Smart feeding scheduler (reminders, cost tracking, recommendations)
3. Productivity analysis (milk, breeding, ROI, reports)
4. Accessibility (bilingual, offline, intuitive UI)
5. Data management/export (secure storage, backup, synchronization)

---

## Project Scope

**Core Features:**
- User authentication & profile management
- Livestock registration & management
- Health/vaccination tracking
- Feeding schedule & cost management
- Productivity analytics & reporting
- Notifications & reminders
- Offline functionality & data sync

**Advanced Features:**
- Bilingual UI (English/Swahili)
- PWA capabilities
- Multi-device sync

**Technical Stack:**
- **Frontend:** React.js, PWA, mobile-first, bilingual
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, RESTful API, JWT auth
- **Deployment:** Vercel (frontend), Heroku/Render (backend), MongoDB Atlas

**Limitations:**  
No hardware/IoT integration, no native mobile app, no real-time GPS, no financial processing.

---

## Literature Review

- **iCow:** SMS-based, low-cost, lacks comprehensive tracking
- **Cowlar:** IoT, advanced analytics, expensive
- **Herdwatch:** Good record-keeping, not adapted for Kenya
- **Tech:** PWAs for offline, React.js/Node.js/MongoDB for flexibility

**Gaps:** Affordable, comprehensive, bilingual, offline-capable solutions for small-scale farmers.

---

## Methodology

- **SDLC:** Agile, iterative
- **Research:** Stakeholder interviews, user stories, literature review
- **Design:** Wireframes, schema, API specs
- **Development:** React.js frontend, Node.js backend, MongoDB
- **Testing:** Unit, integration
- **Deployment:** Cloud-based, user documentation

---

## Technical Architecture

- **Frontend:** React.js, Context API, CSS modules, service workers
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, REST API, JWT auth
- **Database:** MongoDB, flexible schema, automated backups
- **Integration:** Email notifications, future SMS/market/weather APIs
- **Security:** Data encryption, input validation, regular audits

---

## Resources & Budget

- **Team:** Isaac Datch (Backend), Alvin Kiptoo (Frontend)
- **Tools:** VS Code, GitHub, Figma, Postman (all free/student)
- **Cloud:** MongoDB Atlas, Vercel, Heroku/Render (free tiers)
- **Hardware:** 2 laptops, internet, testing devices
- **Budget:** 0 KSH (all resources on free/student tiers)

---

## Features

- Fully functional, responsive, offline-capable, bilingual livestock management web app
- Technical documentation, user manuals, deployment guides
- Source code with version control and tests
- Academic research outputs and presentation materials
- Improved record-keeping, health monitoring, productivity for farmers

---

## Risk Assessment

- **Technical:** Connectivity, scaling, third-party limits, device compatibility
- **Management:** Schedule, team coordination, hardware, supervisor availability
- **User:** Adoption, feature alignment
- **Mitigation:** Agile reviews, backups, user feedback, simplified features if needed

---

## Sustainability & Scalability

- **Technical:** Modular, documented, cloud-based, scalable
- **Economic:** Free tiers, cost optimization, potential freemium model
- **Social:** Training, bilingual, community feedback, expansion potential

---

## Ethical Considerations

- **Data Privacy:** Compliance with Kenya's Data Protection Act, user consent, secure storage
- **Accessibility:** Inclusion, low-bandwidth, multi-language, training
- **Fair Access:** Affordable, non-discriminatory, support for low digital literacy
- **Responsible Innovation:** Cultural sensitivity, sustainable development, impact monitoring

---

## Conclusion

WANFAM CLCS aims to bridge the digital divide in Kenya's livestock sector by providing an accessible, affordable, and user-friendly management system tailored for small to medium-scale farmers. The project combines robust technical implementation, user-centered design, and a focus on real-world impact.
